Knowledge-Based Neural Reasoning for SemREC Challenge

In this work, we extend TransE and rTransE to make subsumption and instance checking reasoning possible whereby reasoning can take place in the vector space by leveraging transitive relations. We further improve the quality of embeddings using multi-hop samples generated by an agent's policy network. The agent is a neural network that takes as input an entity vector embedding (i.e. state) and outputs a relationship (i.e. action). Through careful design of a reward function, the agent learns a good policy to choose actions that lead to more meaningful and longer sequence of translations. We investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the behaviour and performance of the proposed policy-based embedding method, which we call aTransE.
